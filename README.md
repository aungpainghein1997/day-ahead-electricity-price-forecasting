# Day-Ahead Electricity Price Forecasting

This project predicts **day-ahead electricity spot prices** using **Random Forest (RF)** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** models in **MATLAB**.  
It was developed as part of my MSc dissertation focusing on applying machine learning to energy systems and electricity markets.

## Project Overview
Electricity price forecasting plays a key role in power systems planning, energy trading, and renewable integration.  
This project uses historical data to predict the next 24 hours of electricity prices.

Models implemented:
- **Random Forest Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine Regression (SVM)**

Both models include:
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Lag feature engineering (1–24 hours)  
- Train/test split  
- Performance evaluation (RMSE, MAE, R²)  
- Visual comparison plots

## Features Implemented
- Data preprocessing & cleaning  
- Lag feature generation (1–24 hours)  
- Hyperparameter tuning grid  
- Model training and validation  
- Performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²)  
- Residual analysis  
- Day-ahead 24-hour price prediction
